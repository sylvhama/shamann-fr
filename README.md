A while ago I built my personal website with Gatsby and CSS Modules, see https://github.com/sylvhama/shamann-gatsby. It never had a French version, until now. Instead of using an i18n library I decided to re-write it with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). Reproducing each layout and design was a great learning opportunity in order to compare each tech pros and cons.
